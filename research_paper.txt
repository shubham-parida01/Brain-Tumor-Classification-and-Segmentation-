Abstract
--------
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of a deep learning-based system for brain tumor detection and classification. The system utilizes a combination of ResNet50 architecture and attention mechanisms to achieve high accuracy in classifying brain tumors into four categories: Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary, and No Tumor. We discuss the architecture, implementation details, performance metrics, and visualization techniques used in the system. The paper also includes a detailed analysis of the model's performance across different tumor types and provides insights into the decision-making process through Grad-CAM visualizations. Our system achieves an overall accuracy of 92.68%, with precision and recall scores above 92% across all tumor types, demonstrating its effectiveness in automated brain tumor classification.

1. Introduction
--------------
1.1 Background
Brain tumors are among the most challenging medical conditions to diagnose and treat. Early and accurate detection is crucial for effective treatment planning.

The increasing availability of medical imaging data and advances in deep learning techniques have created new opportunities for automated brain tumor detection. However, the complexity of brain tumor images, variations in tumor characteristics, and the need for high accuracy in medical diagnosis present significant challenges for automated systems.
